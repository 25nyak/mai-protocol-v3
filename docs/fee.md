### What if trader's available margin is not enough to pay fee

Trader is not allowed to open position in this case.

If trader is closing position:

    1. available margin â‰¤ 0, all three fees are zero.
    2. 0 < available margin < lp fee + operator fee + vault fee, three fees split the available margin proportionally.

### What if there is a referrer in trade

Lp fee and operator fee will rebate a part to referrer.

referral rebate = (lp fee + operator fee) * referral rebate rate

lp fee = lp fee * (1 - referral rebate rate)

operator fee = operator fee * (1 - referral rebate rate)

## liquidate

There is no fee in both two types of liquidation.
